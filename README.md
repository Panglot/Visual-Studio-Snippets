# Visual Studio Snippets
Repository with a few of my own snippets for visual studio.

You can add your own snippets by choosing "Code snippets manager" under tools in the menu of your Visual studio.

Then in the manager you choose the appropriate language. My snippets are only for C# for now. There is already a folder named "My snippets" that can store your snippets. You can choose different folder, but its easier to keep track where your snippets are that way. When you click on a snippet you can see description, shortcut, snippet type and the author. With the import button below you can import your snippet files.

When you import your snippet you must choose a folder from the available  and then click finish.
